**James Coen's Social Baseline Theory **

Some papers summarizing the approach:
- [Social Baseline Theory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375548/)
- [Handbook Chapter on Social Baseline Theory](https://evolution-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coan-Maresh-2014.pdf)
- [Description of the hand-holding task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeKNDZujYYk) of the neural social task that Coen uses to test aspects of his theory
   - prefrontal cortex lights up when anticipating feeling pain (electric shock) and it is dramatically reduced when holding the hands of a loved one, compared to not holding anyone's hand or a stranger's hand. 

Summary of theory by Coen: Social Baseline Theory (SBT), [is] a perspective that integrates the study of social relationships with principles of attachment, behavioral ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and perception science. SBT suggests the human brain expects access to social relationships that mitigate risk and diminish the level of effort needed to meet a variety of goals. This is accomplished in part by incorporating relational partners into neural representations of the self. By contrast, decreased access to relational partners increases cognitive and physiological effort. Relationship disruptions entail re-defining the self as independent, which implies greater risk, increased effort, and diminished well being. The ungrafting of the self and other may mediate recovery from relationship loss.

**Basic premises of Social Baseline Theory**
- All animals aim for a net energy surplus
- Humans are adapted to the _social_ ecology, more so than the physical ecology
- Social proximity are energy-saving mechanisms
- Being alone increases real and perceived costs of energy consumption
- We expect to be in relationships that require joint attention, shared goals and social support
- Social proximity decreases costs of activity through (a) risk distribution and (b) load sharing (to be defined later)
- _Bottom Line_: We were not evolved to do anything much on our own. Our entire physiology is different when we are alone, especially under conditions of potential threat (we are in high alert). Being alone during periods of potential threat is "wrong" for humans, at least to the extent that we did not evolve under such conditions. Our baseline is SOCIAL. We are at rest, or neurally and more broadly physically, we are at our baseline, neutral levels when we are around those who take care of us and, in turn, we take care of.

**Main experimental task testing SBT assumptions**
Neural threat response in social vs non-social context (Coen et al., 2006)
-Three experimental conditions (alone, stranger hand-holding, partner hand-holding)
- In fMRI measures during anticipation of electric shock:
   - Neural response to threat highest in stranger
   - Less activation in emotion regulation regions in partner condition
- Brainâ€™s responses to threat cues is minimised with social proximity
- _Our baseline is calm while close_
- _Being alone itself is stressful_
