**James Coen's Social Baseline Theory **

Some papers summarizing the approach:
- [Social Baseline Theory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375548/)
- [Handbook Chapter on Social Baseline Theory](https://evolution-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Coan-Maresh-2014.pdf)
- [Description of the hand-holding task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeKNDZujYYk) of the neural social task that Coen uses to test aspects of his theory
   - prefrontal cortex lights up when anticipating and feeling pain (electric shock) and it is dramatically reduced when holding the hands of a loved one, compared to not holiding anyone's hand. But even holding a stranger's hand attenuates pain perceptions. 

Summary of theory by Coen: Social Baseline Theory (SBT), [is] a perspective that integrates the study of social relationships with principles of attachment, behavioral ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and perception science. SBT suggests the human brain expects access to social relationships that mitigate risk and diminish the level of effort needed to meet a variety of goals. This is accomplished in part by incorporating relational partners into neural representations of the self. By contrast, decreased access to relational partners increases cognitive and physiological effort. Relationship disruptions entail re-defining the self as independent, which implies greater risk, increased effort, and diminished well being. The ungrafting of the self and other may mediate recovery from relationship loss.
