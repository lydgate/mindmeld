# Private Language Argument

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_language_argument).
An argument or series of arguments by Wittgenstein.

John Locke (and much later Jerry Fodor) assume or possibly argue that ideas are consistent across minds, so there is a language of thought ("mentalese" for Fodor).
Ideas are the referents of words. Wittgenstein in the _Philosophical Investigations_ seeks to dismantle this idea, proposing (restoring?) for language a primarily social function.
He does this not through a single-stranded argument but by a number of examples, if I understand correctly.

In other words... I think it's like arguing that all meaning is intersubjective, emergent, and social, and that the idea of some abstract land of ideas (sounds a bit platonic) is inconsistent.
Possibly this is projecting too much of my own thinking onto Wittgenstein, whom I haven't read in any detail.

Le Guin's argument that all speech presupposes a listener (from [[Isabela Salon 3]]) seems related to this argument.

Thomas Kuhn felt that most attempts at an "objective language" would probably lead to a dead-end, or at least all attempts by the time he had writing had failed.
He was talking more about a scientific language of percepts than one of concepts -- not sure if this matters.
I tweeted that section [here](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1320684682426654725).
