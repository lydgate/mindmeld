## Places to drill down

- Carhart-Harris, "The Entropic Brain"
- Is this a very wrong idea, that is worth drilling down ever-deeper because this very wrong path can lead to some very right/compelling truths? More specifically, this recapitulation idea is so seductive that it can be taken too far, much like a lot of Lamarckian hypotheses are so very wrong once you understand Darwin well. 

## Comments

I'm suggesting by going deep into this rabbit hole, we'd be following Goro Shimura's idea of "making many mistakes, mostly in the right direction‚Äù. There are a lot of ideas that are very creative, and end up being very wrong (i.e., no where in our ontogeny do we go through a reptilian phase). But the process of pursuing these very wrong ideas leads us to much better ones, ones that we wouldn't have stumbled upon if we had stayed in our lane. And this is also the bonus of collaborating with a creative partner: s/he can suspend judgement long enough to entertain a whacky idea, and then act as a sparring partner at the right time, to help grapple with contradictory data/hypotheses/theories that may more accurately reflect reality. But first you need that partner to validate that the idea is at least interesting, worth drilling down
