## Freud

So if Linda B. Smith is right, and vision is what leads to language, then is Freud right, that upright gait changes vision?
Or are the people who think it's about fruit and depth perception right?
There is even a possibility that it is the colour of snakes?
These are obviously of interest given my [[Garden of Eden]] obsession.

[This article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/becoming-human-the-evolution-of-walking-upright-13837658/) suggests that upright gait started in A. ramidus (4.4 mya) and finished by H. erectus (1.89 mya).
