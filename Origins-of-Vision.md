## Freud

So if Linda B. Smith is right, and vision is what leads to language, then is Freud right, that upright gait changes vision?
Or are the people who think it's about fruit and depth perception right?

> The diminution of the olfactory stimuli seems itself to be a consequence of man’s raising himself from the ground, of his assumption of an upright gait; this made his genitals, which were previously concealed, visible and in need of protection, and so provoked feelings of shame in him.

-- Freud, _Civilization and its Discontents_.

There is even a possibility that it is the colour of snakes?
These are obviously of interest given my [[Garden of Eden]] obsession.

[This article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/becoming-human-the-evolution-of-walking-upright-13837658/) suggests that upright gait started in A. ramidus (4.4 mya) and finished by H. erectus (1.89 mya).

## McGilchrist

This "stepping back" seems important for "dividing up" the world into categories:

> By contrast _theorein_, the origin of our word ‘theory’, is a much later word. Here it takes on the meaning we normally associate with seeing, the eye apprehending an object. Interestingly it was not originally a verb, but is a back-formation from the word for a spectator, _theoros_. What I take from this is that it is derived from what was thought of as a special situation, one of greater than usual detachment from a ‘spectacle’. Words for ‘thinking’, in the sense of abstract cognition, and words for ‘seeing’ come to be closely related. The prominence, after the Homeric era, of _theorein_ and _noein_, when compared with the earlier terms for seeing, marks a degree of abstraction from what is under consideration. A related distinction, touched on above, arises between aspects of the mind, between _thymos_ and _noos_: very broadly _thymos_ is instinct, what keeps the body in motion, coupled with emotion, whereas _noos_ is reflection, ideas and images. Already, it would appear, the Greeks were making felt distinctions between thought and experience as mediated by the left hemisphere and as mediated by the right.
