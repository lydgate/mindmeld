 - **Further Reading and To Do**
    - [ ] Gottlieb's epigenetic landscape work: important for probabalistic rather than deterministic views of development and for the ontogeny-phylogeny connection
    - [ ] Don Tucker's work on kindling in depression: important for notions of criticality, phase transitions, sensitivity to perturbations, and depression as an attractor with extending basins over development
    - [ ] integrate work on criticality with... everything
- [ ] [Developmental Systems Theory](http://paulgriffiths.representinggenes.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/publications/C1_41.pdf)?
- [ ] Look up DS book

- Nested timescales
- Carhart-Harris idea of depression as attractor basin

- Read these and come back next week:

1. Human timeline
1. Revolutions

- Phase transitions (that are reversible vs irreversible)
- Revolutions
- Timescales (macro vs micro)
