How did it develop in humanity's history?
How does that relate to the development in children?

I wrote [this thread](https://twitter.com/bryankam/status/1358389275767812102) about the idea that language distances us from the world.

## The Cool Web - Robert Graves  

[Poem of the week: The Cool Web by Robert Graves | Robert Graves | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/18/poem-of-the-week-the-cool-web-by-robert-graves).

> Children are dumb to say how hot the day is,  
> How hot the scent is of the summer rose,  
> How dreadful the black wastes of evening sky,  
> How dreadful the tall soldiers drumming by.  
> 
> But we have speech, to chill the angry day,  
> And speech, to dull the rose’s cruel scent.  
> We spell away the overhanging night,  
> We spell away the soldiers and the fright.  
> 
> There’s a cool web of language winds us in,  
> Retreat from too much joy or too much fear:  
> We grow sea-green at last and coldly die  
> In brininess and volubility.  
> 
> But if we let our tongues lose self-possession,  
> Throwing off language and its watery clasp  
> Before our death, instead of when death comes,  
> Facing the wide glare of the children’s day,  
> Facing the rose, the dark sky and the drums,  
> We shall go mad no doubt and die that way.  
> 
> 1927
