It's 15:55 and Bryan is reading Slavich 2020.

- So to me, so far, the main takeaway from this Slavich paper, 6 pages in, is that the immune system has two systems, one quick and dirty (innate) which dates back to multicellularity, the other targeted, methodical, and requiring training (specific), which is slower and evolutionarily younger, maybe even more expensive, and which starts out very plastic and undifferentiated and must be educated
  - Sound familiar? That's exactly what Kahneman argues isn't it?
  - But I guess specific immunity must be much older than System 2, by an order of magnitude at least
    - Multicellularity/innate immune system ~3 billion years ago.
    - Specific immunity, 450 million years (which is interesting since fish start before that... 450 mya is the Ordovician-Silurian extinction events.
    - By 414 mya you have land animals. It's interesting to think what's happening around then
    - Then mammals 225 mya, but not large ones until 66 mya of course, and the last Hominidae common ancestor 14-12 mya (when presumably most prefrontal cortex stuff starts?)
    - I wonder if land animals need more protection against microbes? Previously it was thought that there probably weren't microbes in seawater but that actually turned out to be [completely wrong](https://www.futurity.org/millions-of-marine-viruses-ebb-and-flow/)
  - I'm not sure about Slavich's notion that only the brain can detect social threats, but I really like his idea that the immune system cannot predict. He uses "anticipatory" in the right way in my view. Others use it in a wrong way.
    - [ ] BK: Drill down on why nature is non-anticipatory and this is important

## Dual systems Models

- Yup. This “dual systems model” has been put out from a bunch of angles.
  - So the question is... Is a two-system approach just an easy one to come about?
  - Why not three systems?
  - What makes us think there's two?
  - Or are the two approaches related. Like... the brain came about in imitation of the immune system. Or is there another system that's more primary than immunity?
  - [ ] We need to know more about these first things that have specific immunity
  - I love these questions. Because there’s been a lot of debunking relatively recently of the dual system cog model. Just doesn’t cleanly map to ... a lot
- Yeah I wondered about that. But I'm very attached to this idea right now that is annoyingly related to Kahneman, which is just that I see there as being two sources for rationality. One is inductive, bayesian, acausal, and social, the other is deductive, causal, and not social
  - And this relates to Darwin vs Kelvin and complexity vs ML of course
- Kahneman is a bad writer. Tversky was smarter. Kahneman as primarily inhibitory?
  - Specialization in collaboration in the explore/exploit roles.
