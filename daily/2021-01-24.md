ii feeling of getting younger.
Not a regression, but a reawakening (Whyte).

### Exploration

See [[exploration]].

- [x] Focusing in (labour) then returning to the whole: McGilchrist.

*Letting go; surrender.*
Meditation.

Abstraction is taking examples and then crystallizing them into something that is indissoluble into the parts that composed it.
This is true not just of piano learning (McGilchrist) but all learning.

## Logistical

Keep going with whatsapp.
Then pull into wiki.

What clicked the best was [Beau's video on Roam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoddCmn3eL0).

Sunday ping-ponging session?

Immersion for social entrepreneurship course.

Models of collaboration which are based on relationships.

### To discuss

1. Workflow model: iteration 1 (everything will change, where do we start?)
1. To Roam or not
1. To focus or not
1. To schedule or not (or mix)
1. Content: the construction of self as always and primarily co-creation; also relates to all of intersubjectivity, but the primacy issue around cognition or interaction coming first
1. Saving voice mails with key words

## Next week

- Co-creation of the self: next week.
