    - [ ] Gottlieb's epigenetic landscape work: important for probabalistic rather than deterministic views of development and for the ontogeny-phylogeny connection
    - [ ] Don Tucker's work on kindling in depression: important for notions of criticality, phase transitions, sensitivity to perturbations, and depression as an attractor with extending basins over development
    - [ ] integrate work on criticality with... everything

- 11:20 Contra you, I like seeing your highlights.
- 11:27 You need a space after dashes, and if you want them to indent, you need to have top-level dashes too.

## Slavich

Carhart-Harris:

> Conversely, in depression, OCD and addiction, specific states (e.g., the default-mode in depression) may be frequented more regularly than others—and this may be observed as certain mental states (e.g., introspection in depression or craving in addiction) or behaviors (e.g., compulsive acts in OCD) being habitually revisited in a stereotyped fashion. Moreover, these states may be relatively stable i.e., their basins of attraction are relatively steep since the patterns of activity upon which they rest have become entrenched.
