Ideas about [[Intersubjectivity]].

- A book where end product. Not about team collaboration; close collaborations that end up being.
- We are **meant** to be thinking together; in reading, we're in dialogue with older thinkers.
- Mythology of individualism and genius.
- In fighting individuality, people go straight to "scene" (scenius). They ignore mentor/mentee and apprenticeships.
- Science often has this.
- Wouldn't this be interesting if we focused on individual relationships.
- Ch 2: Why are we working _against_ our biological ideals (either by the individual genius or group think).
- Biologically stressed by being alone.
- Evolutionarily, small-ish groups. Ontogeny: our selves arise connected.
- Only after separation _can_ we have an individual self, and this self results in an alienation 
- Chronic social depletion at protein level? Inflammation. Chronic rejection.

## Later stuff (more fun)
