I'm really interested in the various ways we might be navigating intersubjetivity differently in the digital now, compared with periods before web 2.0. Related, I think what we understand about these new ways people (especially YOUNG people, growing up expressing themselves and sharing their narratives online from the start of adolescence) are sharing their experiences and identity-related constructions has huge implications for language development, the phenomenology of consciousness, and shifts to a collective consciousness that may be different than prior constraints allowed (there's a rabbit hole we could spend an entire new wiki on). For example, this article: https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/02/18/being-your-selves-identity-r-and-d-on-the-pseudonymous-internet/
* Part of Lewis' argument is that online identity experiments like using an anonymous pseudonym for the purposes of working through trauma and healing, can and does really work for some people
* Similar to our offline social selves, these pseudo-anonymous (alt) accounts come alive when people start responding to them, when people feel "seen." Through social feedback, you learn who you are or are becoming, what works and sticks for others about yourself will become amplified for yourself. And this feedback, critically, becomes INTERNALIZED. You start responding to your own cognitive machinations in a way that mimics the audience you explicitly shared parts of yourself. 
* Lewis puts it this way: "Without any strategy or forethought, you end up with an indescribable sense of “where you are” in cyberspace by paying attention to who and what shows up in your notifications. There’s a mysterious quality to it all. The algorithm seems to route tweets to the very people who will understand what the hell you’re talking about. You think you’re typing inside jokes to yourself, but it almost always turns out that there are others out there who get you."
* The impact of this type of feedback is that you start using these platforms/tools to augment your own internal voices, leaving it very hard to figure out what comes from your own genuine values/beliefs/identity core and what comes from trying to "please" or connect with your "audience"
