* Girard wrote about how people do not desire _things_, they desire being _like the people_ who have the things
(cf Adam Smith: [[Wealth and attention]]).
        * advertisers know this well: people don't want the shirt so much as to be LIKE the person who wears/likes the shirt; we aspire to be someone, not to have things
        * [[mimetic desire]] is wanting to imitate what those you admire have
        * shame is felt when you desire something authentically, out of your own individual tastes or needs, but it's incommensurate with what others who you admire would want or need
        * "One of the tragic elements of mimetic desire is that it induces a lot of self-deception: lying to yourself in order to reshape your perceptions,your experience and your identity to be consistent with who you feel you ought to be."

I'm really interested in the various ways we might be navigating intersubjetivity differently in the digital now, compared with periods before web 2.0. Related, I think what we understand about these new ways people (especially YOUNG people, growing up expressing themselves and sharing their narratives online from the start of adolescence) are sharing their experiences and identity-related constructions has huge implications for language development, the phenomenology of consciousness, and (maybe?) shifts to a collective consciousness that may be important to consider deeply (there's a rabbit hole we could spend an entire new wiki on). For example, this article: https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/02/18/being-your-selves-identity-r-and-d-on-the-pseudonymous-internet/
* Part of Lewis' argument is that online identity experiments, like using an anonymous pseudonym for the purposes of working through trauma and healing, can and does really work for some people
* Similar to our offline social selves, these pseudo-anonymous (alt) accounts come alive when people start responding to them, when people feel "seen." Through social feedback, you learn who you are or are becoming; what works and sticks for others about yourself will become amplified for yourself. And this feedback, critically, becomes INTERNALIZED. You start responding to your own cognitive machinations in a way that mimics the audience you explicitly shared parts of yourself with. 
* Lewis puts it this way: "Without any strategy or forethought, you end up with an indescribable sense of “where you are” in cyberspace by paying attention to who and what shows up in your notifications. There’s a mysterious quality to it all. The algorithm seems to route tweets to the very people who will understand what the hell you’re talking about. You think you’re typing inside jokes to yourself, but it almost always turns out that there are others out there who get you."
* The impact of this type of feedback is that you start using these platforms/tools to augment your own internal voices, leaving it very hard to figure out what comes from your own genuine values/beliefs/identity core and what comes from trying to "please" or connect with your "audience"
        * authenticity, in this light, becomes a very murky concept

[[zettel]] [[innate intersubjectivity]] We are born with the ability to cultivate [[intersubjectivity]] from our very first days, with babies quickly becoming entrained to their mother's voice, gestures, eye contact, and body postures in synchronized, attuned dances that give rise to language.

- Keywords:: [[intersubjectivity]] [[infancy]] [[language]] [[ontogeny-phylogeny]]
- Authors:: Colywyn [[Trevarthen]] 
- **Key Points**:: 
    - human adults' cognitive capacities seem so complex and it is by virtue of this complexity that it's presumed that they can socially interact in the varied ways they do (built on their years of development that includes practical experience, abstract thinking skills, language capacities, and so on); its this complexity that is usually implicated in our unique capacity for [[intersubjectivity]]
    - But Trevarthen argues (and to some degree demonstrates empirically) that infants as young as 2 months old (and even younger) exhibit intersubjective capacities
        - "...detailed research on how [[neonatal]] selves coordinate the rhythms of their movements and senses, and how they engage in intimate and seductive precision with other persons' movements, sensing their purposes and feelings, gives evidence that it is so."
            - [Rhythm, movement, senses](https://youtu.be/8VhSwbQ1rk0?t=12)
        - within minutes from birth, infants are able to will themselves into emotionally charged co-regulated movement and "become part of a dramatic narration of being in companionship with another person (Brazelton, 1979; Trevarthen, 1979)."
    - We are born with a neural system that allows us to pick up subtle shifts in motivated attention in the other
        - the infant knows to adjust and coordinate to those shifts in attention, seeking affection, interest, and connection from the other 
    - Before Trevarthen's (and some of his contemporaries like Fogel, Stern, Bretherton)work in developmental psychology, it was presumed that the infant, like non-primate animals, had no self-awareness and no awareness of other human selves (essentially, they were not yet a "person")
        - instead, the infant needed to get to a later stage of development at which language capacity comes on line and only then can intentions, feelings, and consciousness be experienced (see also neuroscience work by LeDoux)
        - but lots of empirical, observational work started to show the extent to which the newborn draws interested adults' attention and initiates synchronized actions that grow, over the first few weeks, into rituals of gaze, body sways, and affective modulation... long before words are learned, but that function as a sort of protolanguage
            - human infants are born with motives and emotions that fuel action that sustain intersubjectivity and build attunement: "a human being is born capable of seeking and [[play]]ing with others' attentions and feelings in a rich variety of provocative, humorous and teasing ways (Reddy, 2008)."
            - Trevarthen (2001... also Breaten w/ Treverathen?): these rituals that first emerge in synchronized actions with adults become the seedbed of imaginative learning and shared cultural forms
    - These early synchronized, modulated, co-regulatory [[dyad]]ic dances are the basis for not only a coherent sense of self, but also a model of others' minds
    - This kind of fine-tuned co-regulation of affect and movement is **not seen in any other animal** (it's not just pure mimicry, which you DO see in other animals)
    - Darwin was fascinated with these co-regulation processes himself: 
        - "My first child was born on December 27th, 1839, and I at once commenced to make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he exhibited, for I felt convinced, even at this early period, that the most complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual and natural origin." (Darwin, 1887/1958, p. 131).
    -  innate gestural and vocal expressions between mother and infant exhibit coordination by an 'intrinsic motive pulse', a time sense generated and regulated in the brain (Trevarthen, 1999 and also: Stern, 1985, 1999). 
        - there was a lot of describing of these dynamics in terms of music, poetry, rhythm, dance, especially by Stern... He basically argued that much of the power of these artforms took their roots from these very early mother-infant temporal patterning
        - they spoke of "entrainment" a  lot, and how intention and affect would be co-captured (my weird term, but that was the gist) and then played with in an exploratory way, forming the basis of how relationships would emerge 
    - see also Merlin Donald's theory of how the human mind evolved (2001): he says a culture of expressive and creative mimesis was the foundation for the emergence of language. Infectious mimetic fantasy [[play]] 
    - 
- **Random thoughts post Trevarthen**
    - i’d like to think more about how these early proto coordinations and synchronizations and playful regulated motoric dances grow into early concepts, categorizations, relational words, and then full-blown narratives that are internalized but always from intersubjective processes
    - what happens when the grasping, the "apprehension," is not a solitary act and not one about objects (only), but grasping gets extended from the individual baby grasping and apprehending a thing, bringing that thing towards the mouth, the face, closer to the eyes... to  grasping for the other, the apprehension is of the the other, the other's intention, the other's physical attunement, the other's affective reach and how does that extend out into language later? 


## Why this is of interest

1. Intersubjectivity interests me on a purely theoretical level (basic science/just wanting to know how it works level)
1. on a developmental level for the purposes of considering how kids could grow up with another model of learning and creative output
1. and on a very pragmatic level, for purposes of (maybe) writing a book and using that as the cornerstone of workshops/training/public talks/mentorship relationships going forward.

I can say this for many other topics we've covered in the last few weeks. The playful bouncing of ideas between us works for my mind well, and the emergence of new stuff keeps me super engaged.
