*  Girard wrote about how people do not desire _things_, they desire being _like the people_ who have the things
* advertisers know this well: people don't want the shirt so much as to be LIKE the person who wears/likes the shirt; we aspire to be someone, not to have things
* [[mimetic desire]] is wanting to imitate what those you admire have
* shame is felt when you desire something authentically, out of your own individual tastes or needs, but it's incommensurate with what others who you admire would want or need
* "One of the tragic elements of mimetic desire is that it induces a lot of self-deception: lying to yourself in order to reshape your perceptions,your experience and your identity to be consistent with who you feel you ought to be."
